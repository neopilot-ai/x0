# Quickstart



Welcome to v0! This guide will walk you through v0's main features and workflows.

1. **Visit [v0.app](https://v0.app)** and sign in
2. **Start a new chat** or create a project
3. **Describe your idea** in natural language
4. **Review the generated app** and iterate as needed

## Prompt: Describe your idea

Start by describing what you want to build in your preferred language. v0 will generate a working application based on your description.

Try these simple prompts to get started:

* **"A todo app with add, edit, and delete functionality"**
* **"A landing page for a SaaS product with hero section and pricing"**
* **"A dashboard showing user analytics with charts"**
* **"A contact form that sends emails"**

## Iterate: Refine your application

Once v0 generates your initial application, you can iterate and improve it through conversation.

### Edit the Code

1. **Switch to Code view** by selecting the **Code** tab in the preview toolbar
2. **Make direct edits** to the generated code
3. **Ask for changes** in natural language: "Add a search bar to the product list"

## Integrate: Connect external services

Add real functionality to your application by integrating with databases, APIs, and external services.

Open **Project menu** `...` → **Settings** → **Integrations** to install integrations, or prompt v0 directly: "Connect a database to my app".

### Databases

Install database integrations from **Project menu** `...` → **Settings** → **Integrations**:

* **Neon** - Serverless PostgreSQL
* **Supabase** - PostgreSQL with auth and realtime
* **Upstash for Redis** - Serverless Redis

### AI Models

Install AI providers from **Project menu** `...` → **Settings** → **Integrations** with one click:

* **Grok** - xAI models
* **fal** - Image generation
* **Deep Infra** - Open source models

You can also use other third-party providers like OpenAI or Anthropic by prompting v0 and adding your API keys in **Vars**.

### Payments

Add payment processing to your application:

* **Stripe** - Accept payments and manage subscriptions

### External APIs

1. **Describe the integration**: "Connect to Twilio for SMS notifications"
2. **v0 will generate** the necessary API calls and error handling
3. **The integration wizard** will prompt you to add your API keys after generation
4. **To edit or add keys manually**, open **Project menu** `...` → **Settings** → **Environment Variables**.

## Ship: Publish to production

Publish your application with Vercel from the **Publish** control in the chat header.

On the first publish:

1. Select **Publish**.
2. Confirm the Vercel project name if v0 needs to create one.
3. Choose the deployment visibility and domain.
4. If **Commerce mode** appears, review any unclaimed Stripe test sandbox or Shopify development store.
5. Select **Publish** and wait for the production deployment.

After more changes, open **Publish** and select **Publish Changes** to update the same production URL. If the project is connected to GitHub, v0 creates or reuses a pull request, merges it into the base branch, and deploys the result while respecting repository rules.

### Add a custom domain

Add a custom domain directly from v0:

* **On first publish**: Select a domain in the **Domains** step
* **From Settings**: Click **Project menu** `...` → **Settings** → **Domains**

Customize your default domain (your-domain.vercel.app) or connect a custom domain. You can also purchase domains via [Vercel Domains](https://vercel.com/domains).
