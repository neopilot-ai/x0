## New v0 Update

*Released: February 4, 2026*

**What's different about v0 now?**

This is a major update with four main changes:

1. **Git integration**: You can import existing GitHub repositories, and v0 handles branching and commits automatically. Create and merge pull requests without leaving v0.
2. **Projects**: Projects connect chats to your actual app, including deployments, environment variables, and domains. Multiple chats can contribute to the same Vercel Project.
3. **Full editor**: A complete VS Code-style editor is built into v0. Editor, AI agent, previews, and configuration all live in one place.
4. **Improved previews**: Previews now run your code exactly as it would in production. They're more accurate, support larger projects, and work with server-side features like API routes and databases.

### Do I need to do anything to access the new features?

No. The new features are available in your account.

### Do I have to use Git?

No. Git integration is optional. You can use v0 without connecting to GitHub.

### What can I do with Git in v0?

When you connect a chat to GitHub:

- v0 creates a working branch when the chat first has a code change to push (e.g., `v0/main-abc123`)
- Every code change creates an automatic commit
- You can create a pull request directly from v0
- Publish creates or reuses the pull request, merges it, and starts the production deployment
- The branch menu shows the preview, diff, pull request, and CI checks
- v0 never pushes directly to `main`

### I used the previous Git integration. What changed?

The new workflow is fully automatic. No manual commits or branch management required.

### Why can't I push directly to main?

By design, v0 protects your main branch. Changes go through pull requests so your production code stays safe.

### How do previews work now?

Previews now run your full application exactly as it would in production. This means server-side code, API routes, database connections, and environment variables all work in the preview. What you see is what you'll get when you deploy.

Under the hood, v0 uses Vercel Sandbox—a lightweight virtual machine that runs your app in an isolated environment. This replaces the previous browser-based preview, which had limitations with server-side features.

### Can I work on my existing codebase?

Yes. You can import a GitHub repository and work on it directly in v0.

### Do I need Vercel?

For the full experience (environment variables, deployments, previews), your GitHub repo should be connected to a Vercel project. You can still export code and deploy elsewhere.

### What if I want to start something new from scratch?

Works the same as before. Start a new chat and begin prompting.

### What types of projects can I work on in v0?

Web apps, dashboards, e-commerce, SaaS, AI-powered apps, data visualizations, 3D projects, and AI agents. v0 uses Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.

### Did anything change with the pricing?

No. Pricing remains the same: v0.app/pricing

### How do I import a project?

Click the + icon in the prompt bar at v0.app. You can "Upload from computer" (zip file) or "Import from GitHub".

### How do I connect my GitHub repository in v0?

Open **Project menu** `...` → **Settings** → **GitHub**. More details: v0.app/docs/github

### What if I want to collaborate with someone using Cursor or Claude Code?

Connect your v0 project to the same GitHub repository. When they push changes, you pull. When you merge a PR from v0, they pull.

### How do I publish a change?

Select **Publish** in the top right. For a project without GitHub, v0 deploys the current chat to the connected Vercel project. For a GitHub-backed project, v0 creates or reuses the chat's pull request, merges it into the base branch, and waits for the production deployment. Required GitHub checks and reviews still apply.

### Why is the publish button disabled?

The button activates when the chat has changes to publish and you have permission to deploy the connected Vercel project. Ask v0 to make a small code change, then check the branch or Publish menu for its push and deployment status.

### How do I publish without GitHub?

If you're not connected to GitHub, you can publish directly using the Publish button.

### Why can't I create a new branch in v0?

Check that you're connected to GitHub correctly and the branch name isn't duplicated. If the error persists, contact Vercel support.

### How do I open a pull request without getting an error?

Check your GitHub connection is active and the repository is accessible. If the error persists, contact Vercel support with the error details.

### Does the project structure affect my deployment URLs?

No. Your deployment URLs remain the same.

### Why do v0 agents keep failing and consuming my credits?

The v0 agent is constantly improving. If you're experiencing repeated failures, please send us feedback so we can investigate.

### How do I understand my v0 usage costs and token consumption on the Pro plan?

Go to your usage settings: v0.app/settings/usage

### How do I set up internationalization (i18n) in v0?

v0 runs on Next.js, so you can use Next.js i18n patterns. The recommended library is `next-intl`. Check the Next.js docs for implementation details.

### Why does my preview look different than before?

Previews now render your code more accurately, matching how it will appear in production. If something appears broken (not just different), please report it.

### Why does v0 feel slower?

Previews now run real builds of your application, which takes a bit more time than before. Performance should still be fast. If it's unusably slow, that's a bug—please report it.

### Why can't I import my repository?

To import a GitHub repository, you need:

- A GitHub account connected to v0
- Access to the repository you're trying to import

If you're on a team, check that you have the right permissions. For private repos, make sure v0 has been granted access via your GitHub settings. If you don't have an existing Vercel project connected to that GitHub repo, v0 creates a new project.

### Why aren't my environment variables working?

Environment variables are managed via Vercel, and you can follow **Project menu** `...` → **Settings** → **Environment Variables** to verify them.

### How do I know which chat is connected to which Project?

The connected Project appears at the top of each chat. You can also view all Projects and their connected chats in the Projects tab in the sidebar.
