# Design Systems 2.0

Design Systems 2.0 lets you teach v0 your design system once, so chats can build with your real components, tokens, and conventions.

A design system is saved as a **skill** in your current scope, such as a team or personal workspace. A skill is a small, focused set of instructions v0 keeps with your work and pulls in when relevant. A design system skill is not a copy of your docs; it is an adapter that tells v0 where your source lives, which components, props, and tokens are safe to use, and how to wire the system into new apps.

> Looking for the legacy `shadcn/ui` registry guide? See [Design systems](/docs/design-systems).

## Before you begin

Gather any sources that define your design system today. You do not need all of these to start; add what you have, and if v0 needs more context it will ask follow-up questions during import:

- **Installable design system package**: A public or private npm package, `.tgz`/`.tar` archive, or source directory with its own `package.json`. If you only have loose CSS, theme files, Figma frames, or components, v0 asks whether you can provide a package or want v0 to create a new installable package from those sources.
- **Design system source**: The repository or package where components and tokens live.
- **A real app that consumes it**: Often the most valuable source because it shows providers, global styles, fonts, theme setup, and correct component usage. Your marketing site or main dashboard works well.
- **Storybook, docs, or design guidelines**: Links that explain components, props, tokens, layout rules, and brand conventions.
- **Figma frames or nodes**: Visual references that show composition, density, typography, and component usage.
- **Private package credentials**: Add tokens such as `NPM_TOKEN` as [Development shared environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables/shared-environment-variables) so v0 can install private packages.
- **Install instructions and examples**: Include READMEs, setup commands, and examples of correct usage for common components.

> Keep sources consistent. Avoid mixing unrelated design systems, frameworks, or old docs that contradict the current package API.

## Import a design system

Start a new import from the [Design Systems page](https://v0.app/design-systems). Point v0 at the sources that define your system, such as the GitHub repository, a consumer app, Figma frames, and docs. v0 reads them, builds a starter app to verify it understands your system, and saves a skill in the current scope. If a team-scoped import cannot be saved to the team, v0 asks before saving it as a personal-only skill.

### 1. Add your sources

In the import form, add any sources v0 should use to learn your system:

- **GitHub repositories** for the design system source or apps that consume it.
- **Figma frames or nodes** for visual reference. Sign in to Figma, then paste links to specific frames or nodes. v0 imports a screenshot and extracted frame context so it can use the design as reference.
- **Links** such as Storybook, docs sites, or design guidelines.
- **Attachments** such as screenshots, ZIPs, exported packages, or `.tgz` package archives.

v0 grounds itself in the real source. If a component, prop, or token cannot be verified from the sources, v0 should not use it.

### 2. Add environment variables

If your design system depends on private packages, add the required credentials as [shared environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables/shared-environment-variables) for the **Development** environment. For example, add `NPM_TOKEN` when packages are installed from a private npm registry.

> You need at least the [Developer role](https://vercel.com/docs/rbac/access-roles#developer-role) on Vercel to use Development environment variables in v0. If environment variables are not an option, attach `.tgz` package archives instead.

### 3. Add notes

Notes are optional, but useful for information that is hard to infer from source code:

- Global styles, providers, fonts, or required wrappers
- Deprecated components, anti-patterns, or gotchas
- Component conventions v0 should prefer or avoid

### 4. Understand `v0.json`

During import, v0 stores the reusable setup in `v0.json`. You usually do not need to edit this by hand, but the file is the source of truth for what gets applied when the skill is used.

A design system `v0.json` follows this shape:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "referenceWorkspace": {
    "sources": [
      {
        "id": "github-repo:owner/repo:main",
        "type": "github-repo",
        "repo": { "org": "owner", "name": "repo" },
        "ref": "main",
        "mountPath": "/vercel/share/v0-reference-workspace-sources/owner/repo/main"
      }
    ]
  },
  "environment": {
    "providers": [{ "type": "shared-env-vars", "ids": ["env_var_id"] }]
  },
  "starter": {
    "source": "skill-directory",
    "path": "assets/starter"
  }
}
```

- `version`: The `v0.json` schema version. Use `1`.
- `referenceWorkspace.sources`: Read-only GitHub sources v0 can browse for reference. Each source includes the repo, ref, generated id, and mount path. A `v0.json` can include up to three reference sources.
- `environment.providers`: Environment variables to link when the design system is applied. Design system imports typically use `shared-env-vars` with Development shared environment variable ids. The spec also supports `vercel-project` providers with a `projectId` and environment variable ids when applicable.
- `starter`: The starting app v0 applies before building. Design system skills usually use `skill-directory` with a path such as `assets/starter`. The other supported starter sources are `empty` and `v0-default`.

Figma frames, documentation links, and attachments are import inputs. v0 distills them into the saved skill instructions and references rather than keeping them as long-lived `v0.json` sources.

### 5. Start the chat and review the starter

When you submit the form, v0 starts a dedicated chat and works through the import:

1. Discovers your sources and design system primitives.
2. Builds and previews a small starter app using your design system.
3. Pauses for your review before saving anything.
4. Saves the skill only after you approve it.
5. Validates the saved skill before confirming and gives you verified links to use it.

If v0 hits a blocker, such as a repository it cannot access or a package it cannot install, it stops and asks you to fix the blocker.

Take the review seriously. v0 saves this starter into the skill, and every app you build with the design system later starts from it. Check both how it looks and how it's wired up: components and tokens, providers, theme setup, fonts, and global styles. If anything is off, even a small detail, ask v0 to fix it in the chat and re-check before you approve. A correct starter means every future app begins from a working foundation instead of inheriting the same issue each time.

Once you approve, your design system lives in the saved skill, ready to use anywhere. The chat where you imported it is only the starting point — attach the skill in a new chat or keep building in this one.

## Use a saved design system

Saved skills appear on the **Design Systems** page under **Your Design Systems**.

To use one, attach it from the prompt toolbar or reference it directly in your prompt. You can also try built-in examples from the Design Systems page or toolbar.

### Customize the logo and colors

Open a saved design system from the **Design Systems** page to customize how it appears in v0.

To add or replace its logo, select the logo beside the design system name and upload an image up to 4 MB. v0 stores it as `logo.png` beside `SKILL.md` in the saved skill.

Set the colors used for the design system in the chat composer with `v0.design-system.appearance` in the `SKILL.md` frontmatter:

```yaml
metadata:
  v0.kind: design-system
  v0.design-system:
    appearance:
      light:
        background: '#E6F4FF'
        foreground: '#002A3A'
      dark:
        background: '#004052'
        foreground: '#E6F4FF'
```

Choose colors that complement the logo and keep the design system name easy to read in light and dark mode. These colors identify the design system in v0; they do not change the color tokens in apps you build with it.

### Set a team default design system

Team owners on paid plans can choose a default design system for the team. The default is used for new chats when no design system is selected. Existing chats and manually selected design systems stay unchanged.

On the **Design Systems** page, open a team skill's actions menu and choose **Set as Default**. The selected skill gets a **Default** badge, and the same menu can clear it.

Manual design system selections in the prompt toolbar override the team default for your new chat.

## Keep a design system up to date

You can update a saved design system from any chat, edit it manually on the [Design Systems page](https://v0.app/design-systems), or [update it with the v0 API](/docs/api/v2/guides/design-systems#update-a-design-system-skill). You don't need to return to the chat where you first imported it.

To update a skill, ask v0 in a chat and include what changed, such as release notes, migration guides, new package versions, or updated GitHub sources:

> Update Acme UI to v2.3. Release notes and migration guide: [links]. The `Button` component renamed its `type` prop to `variant`.

v0 edits the skill and re-checks the starter app so it doesn't regress. Each saved edit appears in **Revision History** on the design system's page, where you can review the files, author, timestamp, and text diff.

Update the design system whenever a source changes in a way that affects generated apps. A typical update should:

1. Identify the new package version, GitHub branch or ref, and documentation.
2. Include release notes, a migration guide, and any breaking changes.
3. Update component APIs, tokens, setup instructions, references, and the starter together.

Existing projects don't update automatically. To adopt a new version, ask v0 to update that app's code with the updated skill.

## Best practices

- Include both the design system source and at least one real consumer app.
- Prefer current docs, current package versions, and working examples over exhaustive but stale references.
- Add credentials for private packages up front, or attach `.tgz` archives when credentials cannot be shared.
- Document global setup: providers, theme wrappers, fonts, CSS imports, Tailwind config, and required environment variables.
- Keep sources focused on one design system and one framework stack when possible.

## FAQ

**What is the starter app saved with my design system skill?**

New v0 chats start with a Next.js app that uses `shadcn/ui` and Tailwind CSS. This setup may conflict with a design system that has its own components, tokens, styles, or providers.

During import, v0 configures a small app for your design system and saves it with the skill. Future chats start from this app, so the agent can work on your prompt without using time and tokens to repeat the setup.

The skill's `v0.json` selects the starter:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "starter": {
    "source": "skill-directory",
    "path": "assets/starter"
  }
}
```

The `path` is relative to the skill. Use `skill-directory` for files saved with the skill, `v0-default` for the standard v0 starter, or `empty` for a blank project. Design system imports normally use `skill-directory`.

**How do I update a design system after a new package version or GitHub source update?**

Ask v0 to update the skill in any chat, and include the new version, changed source, release notes, migration guide, and any breaking changes. v0 updates the saved skill and verifies the starter app again. You can also edit the skill manually from the [Design Systems page](https://v0.app/design-systems).

**Do I have to go back to the chat where I imported the design system to update it?**

No. That chat is only where the design system was created. Update the saved skill from any chat by telling v0 what changed, or edit it manually on the [Design Systems page](https://v0.app/design-systems).

**What happens to existing chats when I update a design system?**

Updating a design system skill changes the shared instructions, references, and starter that v0 uses when the skill is loaded. Existing chats and projects don't automatically rewrite code they've already generated; they keep the code and starter from when the skill was applied. New chats, and any new work where the skill is loaded, use the updated version.

To bring an existing chat or app up to date, ask v0 in that chat to update its code with the latest version of the skill.

**Can v0 use private packages?**

Yes. Add package credentials such as `NPM_TOKEN` as Development shared environment variables during import. You need at least the [Developer role](https://vercel.com/docs/rbac/access-roles#developer-role) on Vercel to use them in v0. If that is not possible, attach `.tgz` package archives.

**Who can create, edit, delete, or set a default design system skill?**

By default, any team member with edit access can create, edit, and delete team skills. On any paid team plan, team owners can change **Team Memories & Skills** in [workspace settings](https://v0.app/settings/workspace) from **All team members** to **Owners and selected members**. When access is restricted, only team owners with edit access and selected members with edit access can create, edit, and delete team memories and skills, including design system skills. All team members can still view and use them. If your plan later changes, owners can always turn the restriction back off.

Only team owners can change the team's default design system.
