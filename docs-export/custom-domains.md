# Custom Domain

v0 provides all deployments with a unique `vercel.app` URL, but you can add custom domains to give your applications a professional, branded web address.

Once you have a deployment available, you can add a custom domain directly from the v0 interface.

## Step 1: Access the Domains menu

You can access your project's domains settings from either:

- **Publish** → **Customize Domain**
- **Project menu** `...` → **Settings** → **Domains**

## Step 2: Choose your domain option

When you click **Add**, you'll have two main options:

### Option A: Use an available `.vercel.app` domain

- Select from available `.vercel.app` domains
- These are free and instantly available
- Perfect for testing and development
- Automatically configured with HTTPS

### Option B: Add your own custom domain

- Enter your own domain name (e.g., `myapp.com`)
- Requires DNS configuration with your domain registrar
- Provides professional branding
- Full control over your domain

## Configuring your own custom domain

If you choose to use your own domain, you'll need to configure it through the Vercel console:

1. **Click "Inspect on Vercel"** from the Publish menu
2. **Follow the detailed instructions** in the Vercel dashboard
3. **Configure DNS records** with your domain registrar — purchase a domain via [Vercel Domains](https://vercel.com/domains) if you don't have one yet, then add it in v0 settings

For complete instructions on setting up custom domains, including DNS configuration and domain management, see the [Vercel documentation on adding domains](https://vercel.com/docs/domains/working-with-domains/add-a-domain).

## Domain management

Manage all domains from **Project menu** → **Settings** → **Domains**.
